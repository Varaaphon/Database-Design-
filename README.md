# Database-Design-
Database Foundation Term Project 

# Objective
Our aim is to design an organized database for managing and analyzing a season in a professional football league. The database will incorporate player, team, and match statistics, enabling easy tracking of player performance, team standings, and match outcomes throughout the season.

The purpose of this project is to:

Create a logical, coherent structure for football data that is easy to organize, manage, and retrieve.
Establish a reliable framework for interpreting statistics related to teams, players, and matches.

# Implementation Approach
To implement this project, we will:

Identify Entities: Define key entities such as Player, Team, and Match, and establish the relationships between them (e.g., players belong to teams, teams play in matches).
Design the Database Schema: Develop a normalized relational schema (up to 3NF) to ensure data integrity and minimize duplication. The schema will capture player stats, team performance metrics, and match outcomes.
Define Metrics and Calculations: Calculate key derived metrics, such as team points, goal difference, clean sheet statistics, top scorer, and best passer.
Generate Queries: Provide example queries to extract important data, including team standings, player rankings, and match results. These queries will demonstrate the ease of accessing key insights from the database.
# Final Outcome
The final deliverable will be a complete database design document that includes:

Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram: A visual representation showing the entities (Player, Team, Match) and their relationships.
Normalized Database Schema: A relational schema up to 3NF, ensuring data consistency and eliminating redundancy.
Metrics and Logic: Clear definitions of metrics such as team points, goal difference, clean sheets, and player achievements (e.g., top scorer, best passer).
Sample Queries: Example queries for generating standings, identifying winners, and retrieving key performance data.
